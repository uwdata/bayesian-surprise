    <p>A sample Surprise Map of U.S. average unemployment from 1981-1998. This page is a demo for our <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/surprise-maps/">paper</a> at <a href="http://ieeevis.org/">VIS 2016</a>. For an explanation of what makes surprise maps tick, check out our <a href="https://medium.com/@uwdata/surprise-maps-showing-the-unexpected-e92b67398865">Medium post.</a> For code, or to offer suggestions, go to our <a href="https://github.com/uwdata/bayesian-surprise">github repo</a>.</p>

    <p>The large map on the left shows the data - the unemployment rate per state. The large map on the right shows the <i>surprise</i>: what states have the most unexpected unemployment rates? Red are surprisingly high values, blue are surprising low. Driving the surprise are three <i>models of expectation</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> A <i>uniform</i> model, which assumes all states will have an equal amount of unemployment. </li>
    <li> A <i>boom</i> model, which assumes states will have the same rate of unemployment as during a recent economic expansion in 1998. </li>
    <li> A <i>bust</i> model, which assumes states will have the same rate of unemployment as during a recent economic recession in 1981. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    We show the <i>expected</i> values predicted by each model, as well as the difference between the <i>observed</i> and <i>expected</i> values. After each year, we use this difference to update our beliefs about the models. Small differences mean good evidence, large differences are good counter-evidence. Large shifts in belief cause surprise. Use the slider to navigate between years, and see how the surprise map changes over time.
